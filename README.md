夏至，全年日照最长的时刻，象征光能的巅峰与生命的跃动。它不仅是一种自然现象，更是一种对极致光明与效率的追求。本项目以此为灵感，将阳光与热度的交汇化作数字形式，在代码中捕捉盛夏脉动，于比特间再现光之所至。

The summer solstice—the longest day of the year—symbolizes the peak of solar energy and the vibrant pulse of life. It is more than a natural phenomenon; it represents our pursuit of ultimate clarity, brilliance, and efficiency. Inspired by this moment, the project translates the convergence of sunlight and warmth into digital form, capturing the rhythm of midsummer in code and rendering the reach of light through every bit.
